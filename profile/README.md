# Explanation of BREAVA
BREAVA: Breathe Wisely, Live Fully! is a machine learning-based air quality prediction application project developed by the LAI25-SM025 team with the theme of Sustainability and Well-being. This project is driven by growing public concern over air quality, particularly in urban areas like Yogyakarta City, which has seen significant growth in motor vehicles and urbanization activities. Air pollution poses a real threat to public health, ranging from respiratory issues to serious chronic diseases.

## Background Problem
Air quality is a crucial factor for public health and the environment in Yogyakarta, where motor vehicle activity, industrial growth, and seasonal factors cause fluctuations in air pollution. However, the existing monitoring system is unable to provide accurate real-time predictions to support decision-making. Therefore, this project proposes the application of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method as a solution. LSTM was chosen due to its ability to handle time series data and recognize long-term patterns in historical air quality data.

The research focus is to implement and optimize the LSTM method to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Yogyakarta, while testing the accuracy of its predictions based on past data.

## Reason
This project originated from the concern of one of our team members regarding illegal waste burning by the community in Yogyakarta, in addition to the primary factors of vehicle activity and urbanization. This is because the results of waste burning increasingly increase harmful pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, and SO₂. 
Since there is currently no real-time air pollution monitoring system in place, this project proposes the use of an LSTM to predict real-time air quality indices by leveraging the temporal patterns of historical data from the Yogyakarta Environmental Agency in 2021. The predicted results are expected to serve as the basis for an early warning system and policy recommendations, such as bans on burning during critical air quality conditions.
